 ## Technologies Used
 HTML, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT

 ## Setup and Installation Instructions
 The project is setup in the visual studio code with an html file, javascript file and bootstrap plugin.

 ## Project Objectives
 The project is to be evaluated on the following objectives;


 * Using bootstrap, create a gallery page for either dogs, cars, books, bags or anything that you love.
* Your gallery should have an image,  a name and price for each item.
* Note: you are to create an array of objects for 12 items and use either a foreach or a for loop to display them on your page. Whatever is displayed on your page should come from your array.
* Ensure your page is responsive. Also create a hero page or landing page for whatever you have in mind to put on your gallery. So you should have a landing page and a gallery page.
* It's should also be beautiful. Don't use any CSS and use only bootstrap classes

## Credits
 Many thanks to [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) documentation and [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) for availing resources online. I found their resources very useful throughout the course of my project. Their efforts in availing the resources was very instrumental in the success of my project. I would choose them over again and recommend any individual to check on their resources whenever they'd want anything code related.
